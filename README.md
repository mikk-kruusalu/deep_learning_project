# CNN and RNN project

This repository contains code for the course project of Deep Learning in Taltech in autumn 2024. The task is split into two -- a CNN problem and an RNN problem.

# CNN

For this task I chose a dataset of brain tumor MRI classification, available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bilalakgz/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).
